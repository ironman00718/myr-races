					"Your head is able to take on an ethereal form as an action.  While in this form your head can produce light as if affected by the light cantrip (your choice) and can move independently of your body with a fly speed equal to your movement, you use a bonus action to move your head during combat.  While your head is separated you are perfectly able to move your body and have a sense for where it is as long as it is on the same plane.  If your head is able to see your body no creatures can gain advantage from flanking you and can be affected by spells as long as your head has line of sight on the target. Your headâ€™s AC when detached from your body is 13 + Dexterity modifier.  Should your head take damage you must succeed on a Constitution save with a DC of 10 or the damage taken (whichever is higher).  On a failure your head falls to the ground and you have disadvantage on all attack and check rolls until reattached.  You take the full damage from the attack on a success or failure regardless."
