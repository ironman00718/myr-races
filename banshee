The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. A creature takes 2d6 thunder damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 4d6 at 5th level, 6d6 at 11th level, and 8d6 at 17th level. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain full use of this feature when you finish a long rest."
